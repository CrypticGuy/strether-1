A collaborative effort by #@$# Brownies

Project : Strether is an Blockchain based streaming service where there is an option to pay as you watch
          or instant pay. Transaction is highly secured due to the incorporation of the Blockchain technology. Moreover, the
          concept of pay as you watch is not very extensively used in current time but we thought it provides user with 
          lot of liberty in the sense that he/she doesn't need to pay for the whole seminar/live-stream/media, if they only 
          want to experience a part of the whole thing.

Uniqueness : * Most of the streaming apps are centralized/server based, so we made an attempt to build a DApp.
             * We have provided Blockchain based payment with the help of Ethereum Blockchain.
             * We have incorporated pay as you watch feature which would help user pay for only the time they were streaming the video.
             
Problems Faced : Since, pay-as-you-watch feature require transacting with the Blockchain with just an interval of 1 second. 
                 It needed to be scaled because the block time for Ethereum is 15-18 seconds which is quite huge for this 
                 kind of service. So, we decided to go with MATIC NETWORK since it provides one of the sidechain plasma based 
                 solution for scaling. But, we faced a significant problems using MATIC due to unavailability of a big enough  
                developer community.
